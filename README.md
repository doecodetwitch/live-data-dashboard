# Live data dashboard

## To start a project
1. yarn dev (in the client directory)
2. firebase emulators:start (firebase/functions directory)
3. node dbseed.js (firebase/functions directory)

## The ways we do it

1. We don't use tailwind classes in components. We use @appy directive in css files. ** less clutter **
